# Uncreation

This is a map ported from the [Tremulous](https://tremulous.net) game to the [Unvanquished](https://unvanquished.net) game. It features the hellish landscape of a deranged map creator's mind, sould be uncreated.

It is ported from the Tremulous GPP package from [ingar.intranifty.net/files/tremulous/base](http://ingar.intranifty.net/files/tremulous/base/).

This port is an Interstellar Oasis initiative: [github.com/InterstellarOasis/InterstellarOasis](https://github.com/InterstellarOasis/InterstellarOasis).
